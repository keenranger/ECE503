# Project type

For project type, I'll apply techniques I have learned in the course to a real world problem. I think the best way to check progress is doing exercise based on the knowledge learned in class and known before. The concept of the project will be explained in next section.

# Problem plan to address

For machine learning or pattern recognition problem, gathering the dataset is one of the most important part. In fact it is almost impossible to gather abundant amount of data for machine learning. So I choose to use the public data that everyone can access.

Kaggle is a website that holds lots of competition for data science. They  publish data used on competition for free, so I decided to choose the problem on Kaggle. The problem I selected is Google Landmark.

# Motivation

During the pattern recognition class, I have learned Convolution Neural Network(CNN) for image classification. Classifying image is popular topic these days, and it is easy to explain and convince the result.

Also I personally use google photo for my photo backup service, this project seems quite interesting and relevant to me.

# Rough tentative approach

As data is image file that has quite big dimension, it wlll be not easy to use ANN for classification. I planned to reduce the dimension of input data using the CNN, then using reduced data I`ll classify the result.
